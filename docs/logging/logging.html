    <h1 class="heading-1">What is Logging?</h1>
    <p class="block-text">Logging, in terms of a web server, is the ability for the server to output some information about the status of the server and/or interactions with said server. This information can be something simple like letting a user know the server has started successfully, to outputting errors with the server or even the user code.</p>
    <!-- <p class="block-text">Imagine if your server is running, you make a request to the server but nothing happens. You do not get what you expected from the server. Now imagine if you were not given any information about why this issue is happening? The term `a needle in a haystack` may seem appropriate here. This illustrate how important logging can be when something does go wrong. In an ideal world everything would work perfectly but as we all know things can sometimes go wrong. For that reason Kitura makes extensive use of logging throughout the application. This way you can be sure to know what the server is doing at any given time, so if an error occurs it can help pinpoint the issue as well as providing some useful information. You can then use this information to either attempt to fix the issue or raise a question within our <a target="_blank" href="http://slack.kitura.io/">Slack channel.</a></p>
    <p class="block-text">It is also useful to use Logging within your own server-side code. Doing so will help you debug your own code and help narrow down where potential issues are arising.</p> -->
