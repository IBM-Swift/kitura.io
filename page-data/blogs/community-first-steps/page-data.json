Starting Saturday 12, 2020, I will begin migrating\nactive repositories from the IBM-Swift github organization to the Kitura\norganization.</p>\n<p>This will mean that your package references will change from\n<a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura\">https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura</a> to <a href=\"https://github.com/Kitura/Kitura\">https://github.com/Kitura/Kitura</a> .\nGitHub will automatically redirect your requests from the old URL to the new\none.  So again, this should not be a breaking change.  However it will be good\nfor you to switch your URL pointers at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>I will begin the transition with some less active repositories.  If all goes\nwell, I aim to end the migration with the actual <code class=\"language-text\">Kitura</code> repository within a\ncouple weeks.  This should give enough time anyone with problems to report\nthem.</p>\n<p>On another front, a few people have chimmed in to help with the project.  While\nwe don't have a formal roadmap yet, here's a few things on the top of my mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aim for NIO by default</li>\n<li>\n<p>To do this, we'll need to ensure unit tests are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>running successfully</li>\n<li>updated to include new versions of swift and Xcode</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Automate performance testing</li>\n<li>Enhance Kuery-ORM for usability</li>\n<li>Ensure we have good code quality management tools</li>\n<li>We always need people to help with code reviews and documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If youâ€™re interested in helping to shape the future direction of Kitura, please\nreach out! No role is too small or too big!
