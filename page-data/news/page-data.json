Here's an update on some of the things that's been happening:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>CI improvemnts.  We're still trying to make sure our tests are passing.  There have been a few changes in the industry, that's lead to some devops work here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DockerHub is now rate limiting requests.  Since we test against numerous versions of Swift and multiple platforms, this prevents our CI tests from passing.  I've implemented a private Docker registery which should prevent these problems going forward.  In addition, we have some more consistency and flexibility to test against multiple Linux distributions.</li>\n<li>TravisCI has been the standard CI tool for Kitura since it's inception.  While TravisCI has <a href=\"https://blog.travis-ci.com/2021-05-07-orgshutdown\">deprecated</a> their <em>travis-ci.org</em> services, they do still make allowances for open source projects like Kitura to operate for free on <em>travis-ci.com</em>.  There is still a bunch of work to make this transition on our side.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/Kitura/kitura-cli/\">kitura-cli</a> tool was previously written in Go and provided IBM-specific features.  Since those features are no longer supported by IBM anyway, I re-wrote the tool in Swift for consistency and to hopefully make things easier to support going forward.  Documentation and Getting Started guides still needs to be updated to reflect this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're pleased to announce the latest release of Kitura, as well as a new major version of the SwiftyRequest HTTP client. KituraKit, which is built on top of SwiftyRequest, has now been released at version 1.0.  Read on for some highlights for each of these releases:</p>\n<h1 id=\"upcoming-changes\"><a href=\"#upcoming-changes\" aria-label=\"upcoming changes permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Upcoming Changes</h1>\n<p>The following are changes that are planned for the near future:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>NIO will become the default networking stack for Kitura.  Currently, Kitura requires an environment varaible be set to support NIO (<code class=\"language-text\">KITURA_NIO != nil</code>).  While this is generally fine for Linux builds, it prevents Kitura from building under Xcode, since Kitura-net does not work for iOS/macOS.  Going forward, the logic for this environment variable will be flipped such that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NIO will be enabled if no environment variable is set</li>\n<li>NIO will be enabled if <code class=\"language-text\">KITURA_NIO</code> is any value other than <code class=\"language-text\">0</code></li>\n<li>NIO will be disabled if <code class=\"language-text\">KITURA_NIO=0</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deprecating older versions of Swift.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swift 4.x will no longer be supported  </li>\n<li>Swift 5.0 will no longer be supported</li>\n<li>Swift 5.1 and above will be supported</li>\n<li><strong>Note</strong>: The NIO project may soon be deprecating Swift versions below 5.2.  When this happens, Kitura will follow suite.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>While in development, these changes will be in master.  Those requiring a stable version of Kitura should reference one of the released tags (currently 2.9.200).</li>\n<li>Once this transition is stable, following <a href=\"https://semver.org\">semantic versioning</a> principals, we will bump the major version to 3.0.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"how-you-can-help\"><a href=\"#how-you-can-help\" aria-label=\"how you can help permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How you can help</h1>\n<p>If you're interested in contributing to Kitura in any way, get in touch!

Starting Saturday 12, 2020, I will begin migrating\nactive repositories from the IBM-Swift github organization to the Kitura\norganization.</p>\n<p>This will mean that your package references will change from\n<a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura\">https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura</a> to <a href=\"https://github.com/Kitura/Kitura\">https://github.com/Kitura/Kitura</a> .\nGitHub will automatically redirect your requests from the old URL to the new\none.  So again, this should not be a breaking change.  However it will be good\nfor you to switch your URL pointers at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>I will begin the transition with some less active repositories.  If all goes\nwell, I aim to end the migration with the actual <code class=\"language-text\">Kitura</code> repository within a\ncouple weeks.  This should give enough time anyone with problems to report\nthem.</p>\n<p>On another front, a few people have chimmed in to help with the project.  While\nwe don't have a formal roadmap yet, here's a few things on the top of my mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aim for NIO by default</li>\n<li>\n<p>To do this, we'll need to ensure unit tests are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>running successfully</li>\n<li>updated to include new versions of swift and Xcode</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Automate performance testing</li>\n<li>Enhance Kuery-ORM for usability</li>\n<li>Ensure we have good code quality management tools</li>\n<li>We always need people to help with code reviews and documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re interested in helping to shape the future direction of Kitura, please\nreach out!
